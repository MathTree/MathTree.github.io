    <p>Calculus III is a course that describes how Calculus I and II concepts translate into three dimensions as well as some new ideas and tools. From what I can recall, the course starts with coming up with ways to describe
        3D coordinates, then describes how derivatives work in 3D, then how various types of integrals work. A rough outline is provided below. Keep in mind that not all colleges teach the same exact content all of the time.
        Note that the last section most universities don't cover in this course but will if they have time. I put it there because its recommended to learn and important.

    <dl>
        <dt>▸ <u>Three Dimensional Space</u> - Formal definitions and exploration
            <dd> ⁃ Cartesian coordinate System ((x,y,z) how does it work?) and multi-variable functions
            <dd> ⁃ Equations of lines, planes, and various common shapes (quadratic surfaces)
            <dd> ⁃ Vectors and vector functions. What are they and how does Calculus work with them?
            <dd> ⁃ Alternative 3D coordinate systems
        </dt>
        
        <dt>▸ <u>Partial Derivatives</u> - Multi-variable functions act differently than single-variable functions, then so do their derivatives. Professors usually take a section to talk about how these new derivatives work. Some things they cover are:
            <dd> ⁃ Formal definition of partial derivatives
            <dd> ⁃ How limits change
            <dd> ⁃ Differentials
            <dd> ⁃ Chain Rule with multi-variable functions
            <dd> ⁃ Directional Derivatives
        </dt>

        <dt>
            ▸ <u>Applications of Partial Derivatives</u> - Very important ideas are derived from partial derivatives:
            <dd> ⁃ Tangent planes and linear approximations 
            <dd> ⁃ The Gradient Vector
            <dd> ⁃ Absolute and relative minimums and maximums of functions
            <dd> ⁃ Lagrange Multipliers
        </dt>
    <dt>
        ▸ <u>Integrals</u> - In three dimensions, more convinient integrals come about and completely different integrals come about as well.
        <dd> ⁃ Double Integrals (In all coordinate systems learned previously, over general regions)
        <dd> ⁃ Triple Integrals (In all coordinate systems learned previously, over general regions)
        <dd> ⁃ Line Integrals (Vectors and parameterization)
        <dd> ⁃ Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals
    </dt>

    <dt>
        ▸ <u>Extra: Surface Integrals and Line Integrals</u> - As stated in the beginning paragraph, most classes do not get to this content. But, it is very important because it helps the learner have a solid grasp on how all of these new integrals, definitions, and ideas work
        <dd> ⁃ Surface Integrals
        <dd> ⁃ Curl and Divergence
        <dd> ⁃ Green's Theorem 
        <dd> ⁃ Divergence Theorem
        <dd> ⁃ Stokes' Theorem
    </dt>

        <dd> This course follows directly from Calculus II. The important things you learn from Calculus I and II will be used here to continue the journey through Calculus. It should be noted that
            the knowledge of Linear Algebra would help through this course but is not necessary.
