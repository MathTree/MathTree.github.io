I already did npm install and npm run build, so everything should /just work/ given
the sigma.js library provided. Although, if it doesn't run you may need to install it
as I did.


FOR FRESH INSTALL (ignore if it /just works/ by opening index.html):
Install node if you don't have it.
Download zip from https://github.com/jacomyal/sigma.js/
extract & rename sigma.js-master to sigma.js
cd into sigma.js and run the command: npm install
then: npm run build
